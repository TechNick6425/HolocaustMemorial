<h1>Holocaust</h1>
<h3>Never Forgotten</h3>
- Nick Gauthier
</header>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think of the Holocaust, we think of what we learned in school, but there is much more beyond that. It can give you emotions that you never have felt. It defies logic, making you wonder if these people had morals. Citizens blindly following a man with no logic to prove his point. It makes you think, doesn't it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quote that really makes you think about the logic of the people in Germany was spoken by Yehuda Bauer. "Thou shalt not be a victim, thou shalt not be a perpetrator, but, above all, thou shalt not be a bystander." The German people were these bystanders, doing nothing about this until it was too late. There was a chance the Holocaust could have been prevented, but the German majority during the 1930's blew it, allowing Adolf Hitler to rise to power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think about people being bystanders in the twenty-first century, we can look at the racist issues our country has developed. Citizens tend to want to stay out of it, so they don't get involved in the problem, but by staying out of it, the perpetrators have the sense that no one is watching, causing the problem. This is the mental problem our country has. We stay out of things, worrying that we will be blamed for the outcome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One quote that relates to something described earlier was spoken by Gene Simmons. "It's in the history books, the Holocaust. It's just a phrase. And the truth is it happened yesterday. It happened to my mother. I never met my grandmothers or my grandfathers. They were all wiped up in the gas chambers of Nazi Germany." We tend to ignore the Holocaust, but we can't or it will happen again, as said by Iris Chang, "As the Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel warned years ago, to forget a holocaust is to kill twice." We are told to never forget events such as 9/11, but the Holocaust seems to have left the presence of modern life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has forgotton about many historic events from the past two centuries, just because they weren't publicized well. We forget events such as the Vietnam War and the Cambodian genocide, and they seem to have been left behind. It seems as if the Holocaust was left behind, but it shouldn't have been this way. If the world hadn't have forgotten the Holocaust, the events which we now associate with the words "Never Forget" would never have happened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We associated occurances that we believe should never be forgotten are going to be forgotten in fourty-fifty years. It's just a pattern. 9/11 will be forgotten in fifty years. If you don't believe me, then what happened to the Holocaust? It was just left in the dust, creating the anti-supervision era.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mind tends to think about things that we want to forget. We want to forget about the horrible Holocaust, but we keep coming back to it. We don't talk about it because we think everyone else has forgotten. But we haven't. We still think about it every day, subconsciously wondering, and wondering if anyone else understands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holocaust is something that everyone should think about, because it is more important than you think. It was the massacre of over 10 million innocent citizens. It was the ignorance of the people of Germany and surronding countries. It was the birth of a new era known to us a "terrorism". We have to learn about the past to prevent the past from becoming the present.</p>

<p>"Fiction cannot recite the numbing numbers, but it can be that witness, that memory. A storyteller can attempt to tell the human tale, can make a galaxy out of the chaos, can point to the fact that some people survived even as most people died. And can remind us that the swallows still sing around the smokestacks."<br><br>- Jane Yolen</p>
